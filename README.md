### F1. Robot and Artificial Intelligence path Requirements:

I. Putting a camera to read the position of the person in front of the robot, whether he wants to drink coffee or not.

II. The camera can also be used to find out if the person wants to fill the cup again.

### F2. Internet of Things and Data Systems path Requirements:

 I. Programming the robot to receive voice commands through the mic. Such as recording "audio text" sentences,to enabling the robot to know the request of the person in front of it, whether he wants a cup of coffee for the first time, or wants to fill it again.
 
 II. Programming the robot and training it to pouring coffee, how and how much.
 
 ### F3. Electrical power path requirements:
 
 I.  Place an additional motor if necessary to perform the function of pouring coffee.
 
 II. Putting an electric heater under the coffee pot to heat the coffee.
 
 III. sensors:
 
 *1-  A sensor responsible for starting the robot if the person is within the pre-set range.
 
 In Another context: a sensor to monitor movement within a specific range, through it "the sensor" the cameras can be activates in order to scan the area through it the "cameras" to confirm if the person wants to drink coffee.
 
*2-   Side sensors to monitor movement through it to know if the person is existing on one of the both sides so that the robot can turn to it and then directly pours the coffee.

*3-   A sensor that measures the amount of coffee inside the pot, to determine the pouring angle.

### F4. Mechanics path requirements:

.Adding a "Gearbox" in the arm for increases the lift wight  power.
